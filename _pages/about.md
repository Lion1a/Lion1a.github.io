I'm a Ph.D. student in SIGMA Lab from the Faculty of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, supervised by Professor [Yanwei Yu](https://yuyanwei.github.io/).

My current research interests focus on spatiotemporal data mining, exploring ubiquitous physical knowledge in the real world to improve interpretability in data-driven models.
